# Python NHL Models

## Setup

for Linux Mint, I needed to install the Postgres and Python development libraries before my psycopg2 Python module could install:

    sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev

After that, I was able to install my Python requirements without issue.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
